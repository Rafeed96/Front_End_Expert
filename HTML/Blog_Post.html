    <h2>Introducing AlgoCoin</h2>
    
    <p>The future of decentralized meme currency is here.</p>


What is AlgoCoin?
AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary <span>proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm</span>
that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the
metaverse to its next major stage: Web 4.0. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of
hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time
of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree
equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420
AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.

<h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We
recommend starting out by practicing on AlgoExpert. Next, once you feel
you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's
time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future.
